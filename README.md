# 6.808-website

This is the web page for 6.808 Spring 2019 offering.

## Editing
Info pages (index, calendar, notes, answers) are based on [jemdoc](https://jemdoc.jaboc.net/).
Edit `*.jemdoc` and run `make`, which will auto update the corresponding HTML files.
If HTML files are edited directly, those changes will be overwritten by the next time `make` is called.
See this [cheat sheet] for jemdoc's syntax.

Lab pages only have an HTML version.
Edit HTML files directly to update those pages.
